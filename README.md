Repair/teardown of a DGT-Pegasus chess board
===============

* Fault with piece detection on two squares.
* PCB is not removable without removing the board surface (polyester sticker?)
* Used heat (clothes iron) to assist in removing it.
* Light pipe array is screwed into the black ABS base at the centre and four corners.
* Rear surface of the PCB holds the control electronics.
* Rear surface also holds the LED array, drivers (8xSTP08CP05) and light pipes.
* There are row/column tracks on the front and rear of the PCB running to each square - some kind of inductive piece detection (a short range metal detector?)
* There was a broken track at the end of a row/column leading to inconsistent/missing piece detection.
* Track was repaired and following board calibration (normal process of using the board) seems to work as intended.
