Repair/teardown of a DGT-Pegasus chess board
===============

* Fault with piece detection on two squares.
* PCB is not removable without removing the board surface (polyester sticker?)
* Used heat (clothes iron) to assist in removing it.
* Rear surface holds  the control electronics.
* Rear surface also holds the LED array, drivers (x8) and light pipe.
* There are row/column index lines on the front and rear of the PCB running to each square - some kind of inductive piece detection (essentially a metal detector.)
* Broken track at the end of a row/column leading to inconsistent (or missing) piece detection.
